Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are statistical frameworks that model sequences of observable events dependent on internal, unobserved ("hidden") states. They consist of a Markov chain of hidden states and a visible process of emitted observations, widely used in speech recognition, bioinformatics, and time-series analysis. HMMs are efficient for temporal pattern recognition because future states depend only on the current state
